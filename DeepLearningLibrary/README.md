# DeepLearningLibrary
A c++ implementation of the neural network architecture in two different ways:

/CanonicalNN - a neural network implementation following Michael Nielsen's book

/AutogradBasedNN - a neural network implementation(currently only an autograd engine) following Andrej Karpathy's micrograd

\t/ImplementationUsingLambdaFunctions - method used in Karpathy's code

\t/ImplementationUsingExpressionTree - the same method but using expression trees for cleaner implementation in C++
